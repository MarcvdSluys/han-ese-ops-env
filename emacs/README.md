# HAN ESE OPS emacs settings #

Copy the settings in the file `emacs` in this repository into the file `~/.emacs` (i.e.,
`.emacs` (note the dot) in your home directory).  Note that the only settings
lines are in the section custom-set-variables.  If you don't have a `.emacs` file yet,
download this file and rename it to `.emacs`.  In that case, you could do (from your home
directory):

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcvdSluys/han-ese-ops-env/master/emacs/emacs -O .emacs  # download the file emacs and save it as .emacs`

If `~/.emacs` already exists, make sure you copy the settings lines into the correct section.

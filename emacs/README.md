# HAN ESE OPS emacs settings #

Copy the settings in the file emacs in this repository into the file ~/.emacs (i.e.,
.emacs (note the dot) in your home directory).  Note that there are only two settings
lines, both in the section custom-set-variables.  If you don't have a .emacs file yet,
download this file and rename it to .emacs.  In that case, you could do (from your home
directory):

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcvdSluys/han-ese-ops-env/master/emacs/emacs -O .emacs  # download the file emacs and save it as .emacs`

Otherwise, make sure you copy the two settings lines into the correct section.

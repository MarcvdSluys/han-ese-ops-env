# HAN ESE OPS bash settings #

Copy the lines in the files `bash\_profile` and `bashrc` in this repository into the file
`~/.bash\_profile` and `~/.bashrc` (i.e., `.bash\_profile` and `.bashrc` (note the dots)
in your home directory).  If you don't have one or both of these files yet, download
it/them and rename them to `.bash\_profile` and `.bashrc` respectively.  In that case, you
could do (from your home directory):

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcvdSluys/han-ese-ops-env/master/bash/bash\_profile -O .bash\_profile  # download the file bash\_profile and save it as .bash\_profile`

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcvdSluys/han-ese-ops-env/master/bash/bashrc -O .bashrc  # download the file bashrc and save it as .bashrc`

If `~/.bash\_profile` or `~/.bashrc` already exists, make sure you copy the lines into it,
(as far as those lines do not yet exist).
